    -- Fundo maintains undo history by writing each editing session to a
    -- separate archive file within the cache directory. This avoids contention
    -- and allows for robust recovery, but over time these archives may
    -- accumulate, particularly in projects where many files are edited
    -- sporadically.
    --
    -- To control storage growth, we remove archives that have not been
    -- modified in over seven days. This retention policy is not configurable
    -- at present, but can be revised later if needed.
    --
    -- The cleanup process is intentionally lightweight. It involves listing
    -- the top-level archive directory and applying a metadata query (`stat`)
    -- to each file. The contents of the files are never read, and no
    -- subdirectories are examined. Even with several hundred entries, the
    -- operation completes in under one millisecond on typical systems and does
    -- not introduce observable overhead.
